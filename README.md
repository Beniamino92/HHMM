SpectralHMM 
========================================================================


----- % WORK IN PROGRESS % ---- 


Spectral HMM is a Julia (v.0.6.2) software to model time-varying periodic and oscillatory processes by means of a spectral hidden Markov model (HMM) as detailed in Hadj-Amar et al. (2020) "A Spectral Hidden Markov Model for Nonstationary Oscillatory Processes" https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01676
